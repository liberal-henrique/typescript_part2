//   Enums are one of the few features 
// TypeScript has which is not a type-level 
// extension of JavaScript.

//   Enums allow a developer to define a set of
// named constants. Using enums can make it easier
// to document intent, or create a set of distinct 
// cases. TypeScript provides both numeric and
// string-based enums.
